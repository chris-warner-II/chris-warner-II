### For context 📖,

**I earned my Ph.D.** in [Biophysics](https://biophysics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in Aug 2019,  
where I focused on Computational Neuroscience and retinal processing 👁️ at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).  
My main projects from grad school (represented in this repo) contain:  
  1. A computational model to group visual information in retina based on phase-coupled oscillators facilitating image segmentation.  
  2. A probabilistic latent variable model to detect structure in binary data applied to retinal spike trains discovering cell assemblies.

**Since my Ph.D.**, I have taken some time to pursue personal growth 🌱 and a passion for music 🎶. <!-- My [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/chris-warner-10) -->  
My interest in lyrics and poetry led me to a side project exploring phonemic word representations and transformer networks.  
That side project resulted in consulting work with [CODA Biotheraputics](https://www.codabiotherapeutics.com) applying machine learning to predict protein-ligand interactions (This work is not share here due to NDA).  

I am currently looking forward to the next step in my career journey.

Thank you for stopping by!
