### Hello there 👋. Welcome. Some context 📖.

**I earned my Ph.D.** in [Biophysics](https://biophysics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in Aug 2019.  
I focused on Computational Neuroscience and retinal processing 👁️ at the [Redwood Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).  
My main projects from grad school (represented in this repo) are:  
  1. A computational model for grouping visual information in retina based on phase-coupled oscillators that facilitated segmentation of images.  
  2. A probabilistic latent variable model to detect structure in binary data applied to retinal spike trains to discover cell assemblies.

**Since earning my Ph.D.**, I have taken some time to pursue personal growth 🌱 and a passion for music 🎶.

My interest in lyrics and poetry led me to a side project exploring phonemic word representations and transformer networks.  

That side project led me to consulting work applying machine learning to predict protein-ligand interactions with [CODA Biotheraputics](https://www.codabiotherapeutics.com).  

I am currently looking for the next step in my career and life journey.

Thank you for stopping by!
