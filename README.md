I am currently a postdoctoral affiliate researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, where I am investigating the temporal complexity of human speech with Dr. Kris Bouchard. Before that, I was a Machine Learning Researcher at CODA Biotherapeutics applying machine learning and Language models to drug discovery and gene therapy. I earned my Ph.D. in Biophysics studying visual processing with Dr. Friedrich Sommer at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, University of California, Berkeley. Prior to that, I also pursued a masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering and performed research in robotics at the University of Arizona. Between undergrad and graduate school, I worked for 4 years as an Electrical Engineer focusing on Radar systems at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from the Ohio State University, graduating magna cum laude and conducting geodetics research with the Bevis Lab. 

I am a driven and creative self-starter, passionate about embracing challenge and personal growth. I have self-produced an album of original music in Logic Pro. I have animated short films showcasing original digital artwork in Blender. I enjoy systems level thinking and thrive at the intersection of technical ability and creativity, where both are required to bring various inputs together into algorithmic solutions.
