### Hello there 👋

**I earned my Ph.D.** in [Biophysics](https://biophysics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in Aug 2019.  

I focused on Computational Neuroscience and retinal processing 👁️ at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).  

Two of my main projects from grad school (represented in this code repo) are:  

  1. A computational model for grouping visual information in retina based on phase-coupled oscillators that facilitated segmentation of images.  

  2. A probabilistic latent variable model to detect structure in binary data applied to retinal spike trains to discover cell assemblies.

**Since earning my Ph.D.**, I have taken some time to pursue personal growth 🌱 and a passion for music 🎶. My [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/chris-warner-10)  

My interest in lyrics and poetry led me to a side project...   

Talking about that side project with friends led me to do some consulting work applying transformer networks to proteins.  

I am currently looking for the next step in my career and life journey.

Thank you for stopping by!
