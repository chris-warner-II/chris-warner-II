### Hello there 👋

I earned my Ph.D. in [Biophysics](https://biophysics.berkeley.edu) from UC Berkeley in Aug 2019.  

I focused on Computational Neuroscience and retinal processing 👁️ at the [Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience](https://redwood.berkeley.edu).  

Two of the main projects I worked on in grad school (represented in this code repo) were:  

1. A computational model for grouping visual information in retina based on phase-coupled oscillators that facilitated segmentation of images.  

2. Cell Assemblies.  




Here are a couple of projects from that time.
